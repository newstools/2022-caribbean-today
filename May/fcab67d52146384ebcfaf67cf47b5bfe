GEORGETOWN, Guyana – The Guyana Media and Communications Academy was launched here on Tuesday with the government indicating that it will be virtual, offering those who secure a free license from the government, access to world-class learning and certification opportunities.

The government will partner with Coursera, the US-based open online course provider launched in 2012 and regarded as one the largest learning platforms in the world. “When we came to government, we launched a full round of training for the state media in collaboration with private media and the Ministry of Education to offer a wide range of study opportunities,” McCoy said. “We have strengthened many other mechanisms within the state media and continue to look at ways which continue to make a difference in the media fraternity,” he added. President of the Guyana Press Association (GPA), Nazima Raghubir, said the GPA does not support the idea of the Guyana Media and Communication Academy as a standalone entity, proposing instead that the resources be put into further strengthening the University of Guyana’s Centre for Communication Studies through which tertiary-level recognized credits can be awarded. “We support the intent of continuous training and the GPA stands ready and willing to endorse and provide such training through the established and accredited University of Guyana,” she said.
