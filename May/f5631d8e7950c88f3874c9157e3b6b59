PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad – The Trinidad and Tobago government Wednesday said it would be lifting from June 1, the COVID-19 travel pass system for people entering the country. Health Minister, Terrence Deyalsingh, speaking at the Ministry of Health’s virtual media conference, said COVID-19 cases have been at a plateau at about 200 cases per day, and based on international, regional and local data, there has been weakening of the acute phase of the virus. “We are seeing a waning of this acute phase of the pandemic. But please note the pandemic is still with us. As of Wednesday June 1st, 2022, I am authorized by the Prime Minister to tell the country, especially those who travel, that the TT Travel Pass system will be discontinued. “What this means is that un-vaxxed national and non-nationals can enter Trinidad and Tobago so you don’t have to prove your vaccination status. However, you do have to provide either a negative PCR or antigen test taken 48 hours prior to entry. “In the absence of a test that person will be asked to go into state-supervised quarantine at their cost and provide a negative PCR or antigen at any time during their quarantine period as a condition of release before going home,” Deyalsingh told reporters. He said other health restrictions such as mask-wearing, social distancing and hand-washing remain in effect. “All other measures stay in place, example: masking. We continue to ask people to adhere to the public health guidelines, especially about masking.” Trinidad and Tobago has recorded 3, 897 deaths and 159, 676 infections since the first case was recorded in March 2020.
