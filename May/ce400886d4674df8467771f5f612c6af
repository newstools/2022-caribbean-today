LONDON, UK – Former Bermuda captain Reggie Lambe is hoping to set a caps record for his country in the upcoming CONCACAF National League campaign. Bermuda international Reggie Lambe.The 31-year-old midfielder has been capped 42 times by his country and expects to surpass Damon Ming’s tally of 43 during the Nations League campaign, which gets under way next month. Bermuda will play Haiti at the Flora Duffy Stadium in their opening Group B match of League B on June 4 before away games against Guyana on June 7th and the Dominican Republic four days later. They will take on Montserrat at home on June 14th. “I’m always hungry to represent Bermuda,” Stowmarket Town midfielder Lambe told the Bernews website. “It will be a real achievement to pass Damon’s record, especially as the Bermuda team have always been a big priority for me. Whenever they have called, I’ve been there.” Lambe, who made his international debut aged 16 against St Kitts and Nevis in 2008, believes he can play a vital role in helping develop the island’s younger national team players. “We have a lot of younger players with great potential,” he said. “If we can keep the older group like me, Nahki [Wells] and Danté [Leverock] around, we can pass on our experience and knowledge. “Even when I’ve retired, I think I will stay in and around the national team program. I want to help Bermuda be successful.” After a professional career at clubs such as Ipswich Town, Mansfield Town, Carlisle United and Cambridge United in England, and Toronto FC in Major League Soccer, Lambe joined English non-league side Stowmarket midway through the 2020-21 campaign. He and his Bermuda team-mate Willie Clemons each scored 10 goals this season as Suffolk-based Stowmarket narrowly missed out on promotion from the seventh-tier Isthmian League North. He said his decision to play part-time has allowed him to devote more energy to his new clothing label, Nineteen-Twentyfour, and spend more time with his four-year-old daughter Aliana.
