While this procedure is being carried out, specialists from the municipal branches of INASS will protect the affected workers through the payment of a provisional pension, which consists of 100 % of the affected worker’s salary. The INASS management is working along with the Gaviota group to reconstruct the labor file of the injured workers, as well as taking measures aimed at guaranteeing the relocation of the affected workers and their families in search of employment. According to the INASS, in case of destruction of the deceased’s employment file, an exceptional procedure will be carried out in order to immediately protect the family members.
