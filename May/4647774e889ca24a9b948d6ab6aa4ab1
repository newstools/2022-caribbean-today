In a diplomatic note,  Faruk Miguel Castillo, the Dominican Ambassador accredited to Haiti, said that the Haitian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been informed of the kidnapping and apart from filing a complaint has made a request for the matter to be investigated by the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police in Haiti.

Reports in the Dominican press said the “400 Mawazo” gang are demanding a US$500,000 ransom the release of the diplomat. In November last year, 17 missionaries and their families were abducted by the “400 Mawazo’ gang, after they had visited an orphanage in the town of Ganthier, east of the capital, Port au Prince. The gang had demanded a one million US dollar ransom for each of those abducted, but the captive missionaries made a daring overnight escape in December, eluding their kidnappers and walking for miles over difficult, moonlit terrain with an infant and other children in tow.
