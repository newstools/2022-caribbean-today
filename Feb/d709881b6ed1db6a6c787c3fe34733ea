The hubs will be outfitted with the 1,000 internet boxes (LTE/WiFi CPE) presented to the Government by Chinese multinational technology corporation, Huawei, in November last year. During that presentation, Prime Minister Mark Phillips had said that the donation will assist his Government in its aim to bridge the digital divide in Guyana. The LTE boxes are capable of transferring 4G networks outdoors at over 300 meters and just below 100 meters indoors to more than 100 users at a time. Head of the Industry and Innovation Unit, Shahrukh Hussain, said that Pomeroon- Supenaam (Region Two), Essequibo Islands-West Demerara (Region Three), Demerara – Mahaica (Region Four), Mahaica-Berbice (Region Five) and East Berbice – Corentyne (Region Six) were selected because of the proximity of the LTE towers on the coast. Residents of Region Six were the first to benefit from the initiative. Hussain has urged community members to make full use of the free Wi-Fi spaces. He said the initiative takes the total free government internet access points in Region Six to approximately 66. The hubs are geared to complement the current installation of ICT hubs in approximately 200 communities through the ICT Access and eServices for Hinterland, Poor and Remote Communities Project, also under the Prime Minister’s direct supervision. The Government of Guyana has been promoting ICT development, in the budget that was presented last month, It was announced that $1.3b will be allocated to support the rapid development of the ICT sector this year.
