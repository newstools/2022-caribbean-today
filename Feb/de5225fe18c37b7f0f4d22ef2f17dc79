Valentine’s Day has always been a special time for couples to show their love and be together. Now more than ever, couples are seeking quick, weekend getaways that are close to home, safe, outdoors, fun and of course, romantic. What better way to plan a romantic getaway than with an easy road trip for a uniquely “tiny” escape this Valentine’s Day weekend! Just a day’s drive from hotspots like Orlando and Tampa, and only a few hours from the heart of Miami, the Sunshine Key Tiny House Village sits on a 75-acre island of its own, near Big Pine Key in the Florida Keys. Sunshine Key provides the perfect getaway for ocean activities, or just relaxing at the water's edge for that romantic getaway. The five tiny houses that make up the Sunshine Key Tiny House Village are decked out in a palette of bright, tropical colors and come with lofts, decks, an open air feel, and waterfront views. The ideal seaside escape, each tiny is uniquely designed and decorated to express their own personality with names like, Hemingway, Isla, Kai, Lucy and Pearl. Fit with their own unique characters, and coming in under 350 square feet in size, inside you’ll find comfortable sleeping accommodations, a kitchenette, full bathroom and flat screen TV, providing "glamping" vacationers an ocean air, romantic getaway. Dine together at the table set for two or cozy up in front of the flat screen TV to watch a RomCom. In the morning, step out of your tiny house to the shore of the Gulf, with your coffee in hand, and enjoy the ocean breeze for the perfect Valentine’s Day weekend destination.
