KINGSTON, Jamaica – The Jamaica government Wednesday welcomed the decision by teachers to accept the four per cent salary increase and benefits which they said must be paid before the end of March this year. Education Minister, Fayval Williams“I know that it is a challenging time all around for every sector of the Jamaican society but we also know that education has been particularly hard hit by the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, anything that contributes to stability in the education sector is to be welcomed,” Education Minister Fayval Williams said in a statement. On Monday, the Jamaica Teachers Association (JTA) said that 68 per cent of the 550 delegates voted yes to the proposed package with 30 per cent voting no. Two per cent of delegates abstained. JTA president Winston Smith told Radio Jamaica News that, while the teachers were not satisfied with the offer, they felt it was the best the government could do at this time. But he remained adamant that all outstanding sums related to the new pay scale and fringe benefits must be paid before the start of the new financial year, insisting that “not one red cent should be carried over into the fiscal year 2022/2023.” Government has offered a four per cent salary increase and improvements in fringe benefits with teachers getting an increase in book and software allowance plus a laptop voucher in the amount of J$90,000 (One Jamaica dollar=US$0.008 cents). The Education Minister said that the entire central ministry, its regions and its various entities remain committed to working with all stakeholders to help students recover from the learning loss and to continue the ministry’s thrust to eliminate the digital divide.
