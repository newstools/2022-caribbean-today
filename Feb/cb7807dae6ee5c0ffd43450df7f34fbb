ST. GEORGE’S, Grenada – The Trinidad-based Caribbean Telecommunications Union (CTU) is to sign an agreement with Grenada’s two main providers of telecommunication services on Wednesday. The historic St. George’s Declaration on Roaming with Digicel and Flow, is intended to make services more available and cheaper to consumers in member states. In May 2017, Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Ministers with responsibility for Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) approved the integrated work plan for the 15-member grouping’s single ICT space. CTU secretary general, Rodney Taylor said having a single digital space will ultimately result in reduce prices to consumers. “As we benefit from economies of scale, because we are treating the region as one space, and therefore they can acquire equipment and services at more reduced rates, we fully expect that those savings will be passed on to the consumer that will certainly drive the cost of access down. ‘The region’s access as compared to the rest of the world is still relatively high. But government have also put in place several mechanisms …which offset the costs of services…to places where it is not feasible to do so”. Taylor said that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has pushed countries to take a greater look at digital services in sectors like education and it is therefore important that no country is left behind. “For almost two years our children could only access education using online platforms, so it was critical for them to have internet access and have access to device,” he said, acknowledging that every sector has been affected by the pandemic. “The entire world is now moving towards the digital world of doing business… and therefore if we are to develop…we are to make sure we are not left behind,” Taylor said.
