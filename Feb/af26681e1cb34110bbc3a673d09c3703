PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad and Tobago – The Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) has cautioned Ministries of Health across the region against administering any dosage of the adult Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 years, as they continue to roll out their vaccination campaigns.

Also of great concern, Dr. Extavour said, is the increased possibility of errors in administration with drawing up smaller volumes than 0.3mL which is the adult dose, from the adult formulation. “Errors in the administration of fractionated doses can make vaccination of children aged 5-11 years with adult vaccines a risky practice,” CARPHA Executive Director, Dr. Joy St. John said. “We are awaiting the WHO [World Health Organization] Emergency Use Listing before we recommend use of the U.S. FDA-approved vaccine developed specifically for children 5-11 years of age.” At this time, CARPHA-CRS has not yet recommended the pediatric formulation of the Pfizer vaccine due to the absence of confirmation of the new formulation by the WHO prequalification team under the relevant Emergency Use Listing (EUL). “Unless otherwise specified, Member States should continue adherence to recommendations for approved vaccines. This will help to ensure favorable benefits to individuals and communities,” Dr. St. John reiterated.
