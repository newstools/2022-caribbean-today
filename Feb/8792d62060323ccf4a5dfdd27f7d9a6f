PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti – The government has cancelled Carnival this year due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has killed 804 people and infected 29, 715 others over a two-year period. In a statement, the Ministry of Culture said that while the pandemic had been a major factor in taking the decision to cancel the national celebrations, economic issues as well as overall security in the French-speaking Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country had also contributed to the decision. “Carnival has always been a traditional and popular festival celebrated in all the large and medium-sized cities of the country. The Government, because of the economic difficulties faced by the country, has decided this year not to organize a National Carnival, but to support certain town halls who wish to offer their community of carnival festivities by evaluating the health and security risks,” the Ministry of Culture said. The government said it was also reminding members of the population that “the COVID-19  is actively circulating in Haiti and that it is imperative to get vaccinated to protect yourself and those around you and to continue to observe your barrier gestures”. According to figures released here, 130,440 Haitians, approximately 1.12 percent of the population, had received the first dose of the “Spikevax” vaccine from the Moderna Laboratory since July 16, 2021 and that as of January 30 this year, 93,809 Haitians are fully vaccinated. Haitian Carnival, known as Kanaval, is a celebration held over several weeks each year leading up to Mardi Gras.
