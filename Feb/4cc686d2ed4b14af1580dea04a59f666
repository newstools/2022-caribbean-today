KINGSTON, Jamaica – The issues facing the Jamaican music industry will be discussed during a one-day symposium that the organizers said will center on the recovery of the industry as a result of the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and how it can be strengthened as an integral contributor to the economy. Saniah Spencer“There are many who have been displaced by the shuttering of the industry over these past two years, but, at the same time, this crisis has also given us a moment to ponder, parley and put more in place to grow and consequently reap more from our music and cultural products,” said Saniah Spencer, the marketing executive of the Jamaica National Group’s (JNG) which is organizing the February 28 event. The forum, which will culminate Reggae Month celebrations, will discuss several topics, including the age-old challenge of marketing Jamaican artistes for the international stage; music ownership and royalties, as well as financial planning and management among practitioners in the industry. Spencer says the conversation is apt, as the country and the world gradually begin the journey to normalization, after 23 months of restrictions that have crippled the local music industry. “It’s a conversation we believe we are positioned to lead as a well-known Jamaican brand and people-centered ‘movement, and one, which is important and necessary to raise, given the interconnectedness of the industry to so many other aspects of social and economic life in Jamaica,” she said. The “JN Talking Reggae Symposium” will feature presentations from international professionals, such as management mogul, David Miller, who will speak on the topic: ‘Marketing Music in the Present Climate.’ Miller’s presentation will be supported by Grammy-nominated music producer, Cristy Barber, who will be speaking to participants on the topic: ‘Want to Win a Grammy? The Steps towards International Recognition.’ Minister of Culture, Entertainment, Gender and Sport, Olivia Grange, will lead off discussions on the topic ‘Creating a Framework for the Growth of Our Music’.
