Holness also said the current maximum of 100 persons allowed to physically attend worship services will be replaced with a capacity limit determined based on the size of the place of worship divided by 36 square feet. All other measures remain unchanged. The Prime Minister said the adjustments were made given the rapid improvement in the COVID-19 indicators since the recorded peak at the start of the year. “In line with the management strategy that I had outlined in this Honorable House in November 2021, the science and the data would clearly support a widening of the guard rails to allow more economic activity,” he said. “Our management of the pandemic has always been evidence-based data-driven, proportionate and situationally appropriate. The changes to the measures I have announced represent a continuation of the gradual and controlled process of getting our economy back to full productive capacity as I announced in November 2021. We will continue this process to give all Jamaicans the opportunity to earn their livelihoods while protecting their health.” Despite the current indicators showing improvements, the Prime Minister urged continued caution. “While the Government is widening the guard rails to allow more economic activity, citizens must continue to diligently follow the protocols to keep themselves, their families and loved ones safe.”
