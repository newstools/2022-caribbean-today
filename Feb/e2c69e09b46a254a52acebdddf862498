According to Foreign Affairs Minister Kamina Johnson Smith, Jamaican students in Ukraine should check on flight availability and ensure that their Jamaican travel documents are in order. “Our Embassy in Berlin remains available for consultations on individual emergency needs and concerns,” she said. Johnson Smith said students are concerned about their studies as the semester re-started last Monday. We have continued to make enquiries as to the provisions that may be made by universities for students who may need to leave due to circumstances beyond their control,” she said. The Foreign Affairs Minister  said the university at which most of the Jamaican students are registered reported that there is calm continuation of education but as circumstances change, the students will be notified of any adjustments in timetable and modality of study. The ministry said she has noted that an increasing number of countries have issued advisories encouraging their nationals to leave Ukraine by commercial or private means before further escalation of tension. She also said the Jamaican government continues to engage with its partners to ensure it has the clearest facts and is aware of the rapidly changing circumstances in the region.
