We must, today, more than ever, direct our patriotic approach towards unity, equality and fraternity. We must banish hatred, division and conflicts of all kinds which have hindered the progress and development of our society for ages.” He told the population in the French-speaking Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country that they all have a duty to rebuild the country, which in recent years have been hit by several devastating earthquakes, spikes in criminal activities including kidnappings for ransom and continued socio-economic problems. “Together, let’s consolidate our democracy and the rule of law. Together, let’s work for a stable and prosperous nation, for a new Haiti, more tolerant and more united. “Even today, it is necessary, even urgent, to provide ourselves with a new, more appropriate text which, from an inclusive and participatory perspective, will have to take into account our aspirations for development, good governance, in a context of rule of law,” Henry wrote.
