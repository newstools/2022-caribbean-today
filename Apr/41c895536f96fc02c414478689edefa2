We wish him all the best in his new role as US Ambassador to Jamaica,” said Hochul. “New Yorkers deserve to be represented in the fullest capacity, and an election to fill the ambassador’s seat is necessary to ensure their voices are heard. I look forward to working with the next elected leader and encourage people living in the 58th District to get out and vote,” she added. Prior to his departure for Jamaica, Perry had fully supported Monique Chandler-Waterman, a Brooklyn-based community advocate and daughter of Jamaican and Barbadian immigrants, to replace him as representative for the 58th District. Perry said he was “proud” to support Chandler-Waterman as his successor, adding that “the district will be in good hands. “She is a natural leader in every sense of the word, and her roots go deep in this community,” the new ambassador told the Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC), adding “Monique is the best of us, and she will fight to make sure everyone has access to quality public schools, affordable housing and community-based health care”. Chandler-Waterman, a lifelong resident of the East Flatbush, Canarsie and Brownsville communities in Brooklyn, said she was “so honored” to receive Perry’s support.
