The Prime Minister further noted that she hoped the planting of trees would inspire the future of Barbados. During the short ceremony,  Mottley said she shared plans with President Kagame to construct a burial ground at Newton, Christ Church, as the island sought to establish a memorial to prevent a repetition of slavery and forced labor. Meanwhile, the Rwanda President said he was honored to join other dignitaries who planted trees in the National Botanical Gardens, and noted that the trees were a tribute to Barbados’ commitment to preserving the quality of life for its citizens. In a short address, he described it as a fitting way to conclude his visit to the island, which, he said was “memorable and meaningful”. Following the planting of each tree, Mottley and Kagame, unveiled a plaque to symbolize the occasion.
