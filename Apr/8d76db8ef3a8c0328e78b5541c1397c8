GEORGETOWN, Guyana – A new rugby academy, spearheaded by the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport’s National Sports Commission in partnership with the Guyana Rugby Football Union (GRFU) has been launched to foster and harness the raw talent of players between the ages six and 19. Director of Sport Steve NinvalleIt is one of several sports academies being rolled out in keeping with a promise by the government. “This nursery and this academy are something that was just an idea maybe a year or two years ago. As a matter a fact, it is something that is enshrined in the manifesto of the PPP/C Government and it was an idea and then it became a promise and it is now becoming a reality,” Director of Sport Steve Ninvalle said. Head of the sport academy, Cristy Campbell encouraged young people in Guyana to utilize the opportunities available through the sport to develop their talents. “I hope this opportunity that is presented to you is grasped with full hands. I hope you deliver what is expected and use the resources that we are presenting to you to be better athletes, to develop your talent, and to move on to the international scene,” she said. “The academy is just not about training, this is not the only aspect that we are offering; it also comes with a physiotherapist, a nutritionist and we also have a sport psychologist, who are all employed by the National Sports Commission to help you to be rounded athletes.” About 160 persons will participate in the program. According to Campbell, an academy will soon be launched for swimmers. Within the last few months, the ministry, through the NSC, has launched six academies, including for badminton, athletics and table tennis.
