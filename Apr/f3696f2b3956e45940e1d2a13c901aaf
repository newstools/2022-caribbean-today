Haik is leading the mission in corporation with the United States Burn Advocates Network (BAN) to the hospitals here that are still overwhelmed with the wounded. Prior to departing Israel, Haik said the team is prepared to help as many burn victims as possible. “Unfortunately, a few months ago they had a big fire disaster and they still have injured patients that we need to treat. We’re going to do as many surgeries as we can to try and help their wounds. We will [also] bring equipment they are lacking and teach them how to use it and leave it there so they can continue rehabilitating Haiti,” he added. Haik, who also heads Sheba’s division of plastic surgery and is a professor at Tel Aviv University, has previously brought his expertise to Haiti. In February 2020, on the 10th anniversary of the earthquake that devastated Haiti in 2010, Haik led an international team of burn surgeons, sponsored by BAN, to set up the first pediatric laser for treating disfiguring burn scars in children at Sacre Coeur Hospital in Milot. Haik has often undertaken humanitarian medical missions in countries such as Ukraine, Romania, Cameroon, Congo and Guatemala.
