GEORGETOWN, GUYANA - The government of Guyana has said it intends to launch its own hatching egg industry as it seeks to reduce on the importation of approximately 52 million eggs each year at an estimated cost of GUY$350 million (One Guyana dollar=US$0.004 cents). President Dr. Irfaan Ali has described the egg industry here as a “low hanging fruit, that is a market we can capture. “We are now looking at a project that will enable us to produce our hatching eggs all here in Guyana locally.” He said that his administration would work with several stakeholders to be part of the project and will ensure there is sustainable production of hatching eggs locally and eventually for the export market. “These are the initiatives that are transformative in nature. These are the initiatives that will propel the economy, these are the initiatives that will bring direct benefits to the farmer and enhance our diversification program, these are some of the initiatives that will ensure our economy is built on many pillars,” President Ali said. He said government has started working with the large poultry producers in a consortium to produce their own corn and soya for the production of feed to support the poultry industry, and that this is part of government’s plan for Guyana to become self-sufficient, as there are rising food prices and supply shortages.
