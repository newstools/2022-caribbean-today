It began with the Oasis 50 years ago, and Nassau remains a premier port of call to this day,” he added. The Royal Caribbean Group said that vacationers will first set sail on seven-night cruises to the Caribbean before heading to Barcelona, Spain, and Rome to kick off summer vacations in the Mediterranean in May. It said that in November, the cruise ship returns to explore the tropical shores of the Caribbean from its year-round home, Port Canaveral in Florida.
