Charlestown, Nevis – The Nevis Tourism Authority reports that excitement among swimmers and spectators alike is palpable as the destination prepares for the Nevis to St. Kitts Cross Channel Swim. After having to cancel the event over the course of the past two years due to COVID-19 restrictions, this celebrated event returns to mark its 20th anniversary on March 27. Beginning at Oualie Beach on Nevis and finishing at Cockleshell Beach on St. Kitts, swimmers cross the ‘Narrows’ between the two islands at a distance of 2.5 miles. The challenge, organized by the SKN Swimming Federation, is open to competitive swimmers and no vice enthusiasts alike, with swimmers as young as 8 years old having been known to participate. Along the way, swimmers can glimpse stunning marine life, like turtles and schools of fish, as they swim right next to them. “This year’s Channel Swim promises to be a particularly inspiring event,” said Devon Liburd, Nevis Tourism Authority interim CEO. “We’ve waited a long time to celebrate the 20th anniversary of this event and the important work that the SKN Swimming Federation does for our local children. I know I speak for our entire community when I say how glad I am that this day has finally come.” Registration remains open to swimmers until March 25, with prizes awarded to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place male and female finishers in each of the following age categories: under 19, 20-39, 40-59, and over 60. In conjunction with the event, the SKN Swimming Federation invites attendees to donate new or used swim goggles to ‘Gifting Goggles.’ This initiative distributes goggles to children participating in swim instruction programs throughout the islands in support of the Federation’s mission to promote safe open water swimming both as a sport and leisure activity.
