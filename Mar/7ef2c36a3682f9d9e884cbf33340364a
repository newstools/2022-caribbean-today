He noted that the Government has a “commitment and responsibility” to get “our students” out of harm’s way. Campbell said that the 20 students will be given all the support needed “in what must be a traumatizing experience”. “We have to ensure their mental state is ready,” he added. The State Minister said the Jamaican Government stands in solidarity with Ukraine. For his part, student Matthew DeSilva said he will always remember the generosity of the Ukrainians, adding that he has “only wonderful memories” of the people. “I can only speak for myself. We entered Ukraine to study. I studied engineering but I want to make this clear to everybody… we wouldn’t have been able to leave this country without the help of these people,” he said. Medical student Chelsea Williams, who is in the fourth year of her program, said she is happy to be back in Jamaica and will be taking time to contemplate her next steps. “I’m practically two years away from finishing. The university, if it has been destroyed, I don’t know how I will get my transcript… to start school somewhere else,” she noted.
