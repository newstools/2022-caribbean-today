It said that decisions adopted in the specific areas of enhanced cooperation will only be binding on the participating member states and the rights and obligations created will be solely for those member states and their nationals. “Established areas of enhanced cooperation will, however, be open to other member states, subject to compliance with the conditions of participation and the decisions already adopted,” the CARICOM Secretariat said, adding that the protocol takes effect after ratification by the signatories to the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas. It said Barbados, Belize, Dominica, and Grenada have signed the protocol.
