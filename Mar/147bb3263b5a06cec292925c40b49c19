NASSAU, Bahamas – The Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, has declared that the monarchy will continue to support with “pride and respect” any decision made by the governments of The Bahamas, Jamaica and Belize, in the future. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are Greeted by Audrey Oswell, President and Managing Director of Atlantis Paradise IslandSpeaking on Friday, on the final night of a Caribbean tour, Prince William, the second in line to the British throne said – “Relationships evolve. Friendship endures.” The Duke of Cambridge was speaking at a reception that was hosted by Governor General Sir Cornelius A. Smith. “And with Jamaica celebrating 60 years of independence this year, and Belize celebrating 40 years of independence last year, I want to say this: we support with pride and respect your decisions about your future,” William said. The Caribbean tour undertaken by the Duke and his wife Kate, was intended to mark the 70th anniversary of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The future role of the royal family in the Caribbean has been a central topic throughout the duke and duchess’s eight-day tour. After the couple left Belize on Tuesday, a government minister announced a new commission would begin consulting with people across the country on how the “decolonization process” should proceed. On Wednesday, during a meeting in Jamaica, Prime Minister Andrew Holness said his country intended to “fulfil our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country”. Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis has not commented on the issue, although last year said it was “not on the agenda”. The Bahamas, a former British colony, gained independence in 1973, but it remains a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and recognizes the British monarch as head of state.
