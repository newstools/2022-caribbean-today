St. George’s, Grenada W.I. – As destinations worldwide recover from the pandemic, trends indicate that travelers are looking for experiences that allow them to connect deeper to a destination, support sustainability, and positively impact the places they visit. To meet this trend and as part of its continuing sustainability efforts, Grenada Tourism Authority (GTA) is proud to launch its new Voluntourism Program for visitors seeking to engage with the local community and culture while making a tangible impact. For travelers, voluntourism provides an intimate and memorable experience which allows them to make deep and meaningful connections with our local community whilst leaving a positive footprint on the island,” said Petra Roach, CEO Grenada Tourism Authority. “We want to connect through their hearts and passions, which will in turn increase their propensity to return to the island. We want to join together to be better global citizens and be intentional about ensuring a positive impact and bringing about positive change.” Voluntourism opportunities are available year-round in a variety of sectors such as agriculture, environment, education, and health.
