ST. JOHN’S, Antigua – The Antigua and Barbuda government says a Jamaica-based investment group is to spend an estimated five million US dollars creating an entertainment and amusement center at one of the many Forts here. A statement issued after the weekly Cabinet meeting that ended on Wednesday evening, did not name the investment group, but said that the group will develop “one of the many Forts that continue to exist after nearly three hundred years. “The group will spend up to five million US dollars to make the old fort reflect history, as well as to allow for exploration of caves and other natural assets, including the use of a beach and a large rock which separates it from the Fort.” The statement said that the investment group “has been around for more than 35 years and has developed many tourism sites in Barbados, Jamaica and other Caribbean islands,” adding that the “group has been very successful and plans to arrange their site so that it attracts several generations of visitors”.
