HAVANA, Cuba – The government of Belgium has donated 29 buses to Cuba, that will be used to reinforce public transportation here and to support cultural institutions. Belgium’s ambassador to Havana, Jean-Jacques Bastien pointed to the tight relations between both countries and said the donation from Brussels should contribute to cushion current transportation problems mainly caused by the economic, commercial and financial blockade of the island nation. The director of Transportation Planning at the Havana General Transport Office Lauger Medina said the buses could benefit some 32,000 citizens each day. He said the buses are second-hand so they will be submitted to technical tests before entering operations. Maintenance will be coordinated with the office of Mercedes Benz in Cuba, said the official who added that the necessary fuel has been guaranteed for the new equipment. Officials at Havana’s Provincial Transportation Enterprise, the main operator in the city capital says it has only 50 percent transportation availability.
