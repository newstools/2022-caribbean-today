On Friday, previously unbeaten Uganda suffered a shock 62-run defeat against Jersey, the Channel Islanders owing their success largely to opener Nick Greenwood’s 80 in their 255 for six and leg spinner Dominic Blampied, the seventh bowler used, who finished with a career-best five for 18 as Uganda were bowled out for 193 in reply. Bermuda went into the Uganda leg with one point gained from a no-result in an abandoned match against Kenya, having suffered defeats by Uganda, Jersey, Hong Kong and Italy. Hosts Uganda topped the table after the first leg, which was played in Oman in December 2019, with a perfect record of five victories. The third and final leg of the group stage will be played in Jersey in August.
