The DHS in March 2021 said that it would exercise prosecutorial discretion to defer the physical presence requirements associated with the Immigration and Nationality Act. ICE said this policy only applies to employers and workplaces that are operating remotely. “If there are employees physically present at a work location, no exceptions are being implemented at this time for in-person verification of identity and employment eligibility documentation for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification.” “Going forward DHS will continue to monitor the ongoing national emergency and provide updated guidance as needed,” ICE said.
